---

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
---

Hangman is a classic word guessing game in which you get a set number of guesses(6) to identify a selected word.

## Game Rules
---

1. Using the alphabet keys on the keyboard guess one letter at a time of a hidden word.
2. With each incorrect guess, a body part is drawn on the displayed gallows. You get 6 guesses before the stick man is hanged. 
3. If the stickman is hanged, you lose the game and a pop up will present a "you lost" message as well as revealling the hidden word. You will be presented with a button to reset tha game and play again.
4. If you guess the word and win the game, a pop up will present a "you won" message.
5. The game can be restarted at anytime via the available button.
6. These rules are available by hovering over the helkp button.
